# Dragons Game

Go on an adventure with a Dragon of your own. With this basic Java app, you can battle other dragons and gain points. Gain as many points as you can before your dragon faints. 

Dragons can be of three different types with attacks depending on their types. Each type is effective/ineffective towards other types, so make sure to pick your attacks carefully. Otherwise, run away from the battle and go heal your companion to keep playing.
